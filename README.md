# LinkedIn Profile Data Extraction:
For the second task, I was provided with a CSV file containing information about individual personalities on LinkedIn. My responsibility was to extract specific details such as company, position, Twitter ID, and a Twitter snippet using API keys and a Custom Search Engine (CSE) ID.

# Multi-Key Data Extraction Program:
To enhance efficiency, I developed a program capable of utilizing multiple API keys for the extraction of data as part of the aforementioned LinkedIn profile data extraction task.

# Feature Mining and Data Cleanup:
Task four involved creating a program for feature mining and data cleanup on the scraped blogs obtained in task one. This process aimed to enhance the quality of the extracted data for subsequent analysis.
